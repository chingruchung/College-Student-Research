# Speeding up diffusion maps with three methods

## Abstract
In classification, diffusion maps can help us to simplify the high dimensional complicated data into a simple one in low dimensional space. However, the complexity of diffusion maps is $$O(n^3)$$, is too expensive to solve a huge mount of input. Here We use three methods: Nystrom method, k-nearest method and neural network successfully speeding up Diffusion maps, getting a approximated result with it in extremely fast time ($O(n)$).
